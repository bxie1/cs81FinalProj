Added "torque" to the simulation. Now the farthest weights have exert more torque.
Added 3 output possibilities: 0, .5, 1; .5 means balanced. 0 is the left heavier. 1 is the right heavier.

Backlog of todos --

POA for organizing the training set data into different classification problems;

1. Balanced: for every balanced problem, add it to a list of balanced probs
	figure out the percent correct of the balanced problems
